<h1>Module 1 Project</h1>

<h2>BY Abzal and Jesus<h2>

<p>Started with TheMovieDB.org API grabbing all the movie data required for this project using the official API from the site. All the data gathered from this website's API is located under the branch Abzal_project_1, it contains all the raw data included with clean data and a notebook containing all the informational code that was used for gathering.<p>

<p>After, we Web Scraped Box Office Mojo creating an awsome way of making web scrapping easier for later use.
Everything under Jesus branch is all the inforamtion gathered and created using the web scrapper and it is documented with docstring for each function and contains comments for each part.<p>
