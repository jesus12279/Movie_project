## Project Description
Our Goal for this project was to collect real world data for the movie industry using API and or Web Scraping.
Scraping Box Office Mojo Website to collect movie data @ box_mojo.ipynb.
Then used the API to gather movie data from THEMOVIEDB.org @ branch Abzal @ 1_data_collecting_tmdb_api.ipynb and 2_data_cleaning.ipynb.
After gathering our required data for this project we handled missing values by droping nan values using pandas.
Made visualizations to find correlations and insights on what the best movie genre was and how much they income was earned, and looked for the top dominant movie distributors for 2019.
Found interesting correlations when comparing budget vs. net income for the last 20 years.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept Movie_project within this repo.

3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept movie_dojo.ipynb

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup Pandas, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup(Link to file)
